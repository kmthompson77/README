Any Idea is possible and should be explored

I am a proponent of change and always looking for the next best thing for efficiency. My degree is in web-development, however, I was never given the opportunity to work within the IT sector to progressively enhance what I learned in school. Upon stumbling onto the Free Code Camp blog written from an actual student, I decided that this may be the next step I need to become more competitive in a collaborative and IT enhanced world. Happy Coding!
